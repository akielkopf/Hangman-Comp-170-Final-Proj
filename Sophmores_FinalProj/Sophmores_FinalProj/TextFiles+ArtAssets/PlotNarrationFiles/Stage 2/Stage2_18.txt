Geting up, you make your way once again.  Finding yourself in another new
room. It's incredibly large compared to the others.

In the center of the room is an altar and another Golden chest.

You see door on the other side with iron bars. There is no way to get past it.

Walking towards the center, unsurprisingly the chest is locked. Heading towards
the altar and find five stones on it.

Each rock has a different symbol drawn on it.
Star, Sun, Moon, Mountain, and Tree.

That looks familiar.

Also on the alter are what appear to be slots to place the rocks. You look
around confused. There is nothing else in this room.
