The battle is over and you have defeated your second enemy. 
You lay down to catch your breath. Never in a million years would you have 
thought you would have been on such a treasure hunt as this one. 
“There better be a lot of treasure in this for me.” you let out as 
you get up and make your way on down the cavern tunnel.
