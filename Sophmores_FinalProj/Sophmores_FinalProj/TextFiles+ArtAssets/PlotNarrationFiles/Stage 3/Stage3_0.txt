You greet Odalf with a grin. 

  "I can see you have done successfully." Odalf responds, you catch a hint 
of suprise that you're still alive. 

"Hard but manageable." you respond triumphantly. 

  "I just hope that the next tunnel isn't as wet," you say as you squeeze 
the water out of your clothes.
