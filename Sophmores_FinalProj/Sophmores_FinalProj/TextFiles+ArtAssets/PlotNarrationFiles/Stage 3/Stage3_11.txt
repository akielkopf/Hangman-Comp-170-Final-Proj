Rattling off in the darkness, you decide to follow where it leads. 

  As you draw closer to the sound you unseath your weapon and are able to 
pinpoint where it's coming from.

Dangling from a nook on the cavern wall is a rusty key on a silver chain. 

Every time the key sways it clinks against the rock wall.

"Must have been where the sound was coming from."
